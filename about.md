Konnichiwa! ✨ I'm Miyu, and I love cute things and Japanese culture. 🌸 I was born and raised in Tokyo, surrounded by Japan's beauty and elegance from a young age. 🎌 My passion for cute things has led me to collect various adorable items, from plush toys to accessories featuring my favorite characters. 🧸

When I'm not searching for cute treasures in stores, I enjoy exploring quiet places and beautiful gardens. 🏯 I love the serenity found in nature and ancient temples in Kyoto. 🌿 Additionally, I'm obsessed with Japanese food and enjoy trying both traditional dishes and the latest culinary trends. 🍣

In my free time, I indulge in creative activities like origami and Japanese calligraphy. 📝 I also love J-pop music and am always interested in the latest fashion trends. 🎶
