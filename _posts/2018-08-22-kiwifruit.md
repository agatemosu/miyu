**Kiwifruit** (often shortened to **kiwi**) or **Chinese gooseberry** is the edible [berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_(botany)) of several species of [woody vines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_vine) in the genus *[Actinidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinidia)*.

The most common [cultivar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar) group of kiwifruit (*Actinidia deliciosa* 'Hayward') is oval, about the size of a large [hen's egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)): 5–8 centimetres in length and 4.5–5.5 cm in diameter. It has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart but edible light brown skin and light green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavour.
