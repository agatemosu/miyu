A **banana** is an elongated, edible [fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit) – botanically a [berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_(botany)) – produced by several kinds of large [herbaceous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbaceous) [flowering plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant) in the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) *[Musa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_(genus))*.

In some countries, [bananas used for cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_banana) may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from **dessert bananas**. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in [starch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch) covered with a [rind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_(fruit)), which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.
