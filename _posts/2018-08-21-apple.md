An **apple** is a round, edible [fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit) produced by an **apple tree** (***Malus domestica***).

Apple [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_tree) are [cultivated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture) worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) *[Malus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malus)*. The [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree) originated in [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia), where its wild ancestor, *[Malus sieversii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malus_sieversii)*, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by [European colonists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas).
